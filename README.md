# AWS-ECS---Containerized-Web-App-Deployment-using-AWS-ECS-Fargate-with-ALB-AWS-ECS-Fargate-ALB-IAM
Developed and deployed a containerized web application on AWS using ECS Fargate with Application Load Balancer. Designed a scalable architecture by creating ECS clusters, task definitions, services, and IAM roles. 
• Designed and deployed a scalable container-based architecture using AWS ECS with Fargate launch type and Application Load Balancer (ALB) for load distribution.
• Created ECS task definitions using Docker images (nginxdemos/hello), configured services, subnets, and security groups across multiple AZs.
• Enabled seamless service discovery and dynamic scaling by integrating Fargate tasks with Target Groups, and verified health checks and load balancing through ALB DNS endpoints.
• Automated infrastructure with IAM Execution Roles, CloudWatch logging, and scaling of tasks to simulate real-world traffic handling.
